# 2.1.1 - 2019-08-06

- Upgrade `axios` dependency for security update

# 2.1.0 - 2019-07-17

- Add a `--skip` flag to indicate a commit is not going to be built (and still tag the PR as passing).
- Allow `chromatic` story parameters to be functions of `({ id, kind name })` -- in particular e.g. `chromatic: { viewport: () => [/*something dynamic based on story info */]}`
- A fix for issues involving story listings differing between browsers.

# 2.0.0 - 2019-07-17

- We now default to building and uploading your storybook, rather than starting and tunneling it. This has many benefits including increased reliability and better support for Live View. You'll need to ensure you have a `build-storybook` script defined in `package.json` (as added by the Storybook CLI). To get the old behaviour, pass `-s` to the `chromatic test` command.

- We now support HTTPS storybooks (using the `--ssl` flag and friends).

- We polyfill `window.Intl` in our JSDOM environment.

- We polyfill `window.customElements` in our JSDOM environment.

# 1.4.0 - 2019-06-20

# 1.3.3 - 2019-04-19

- Fixed issue with uploaded builds and Storybook 5 URLs.

# 1.3.2 - 2019-04-02

- Added a new `diffThreshold` Storybook parameter you can use to control the anti-aliasing threshold we use for diffing if you find that certain images are tripping our diff.

- Fix an issue with handling rebased branches in unusual CI systems.

# 1.3.1 - 2019-03-21

- Add a dedicated endpoint for `isChromatic` so you don't need to load our full package to use it (which is useful if you want to use it inside your app, which we generally don't advise).

# 1.3.0 - 2019-02-28

- Change the default behaviour around starting the storybook; if we find something running on the port, we assume it's your storybook, instead of requiring you to pass `-S/--do-not-start`.

- Add a new flag `--preserve-missing` which means any stories that are missing from the last build will be assumed to be unchanged. Use this if you are doing tricky things around dynamically building your Storybook based on code changes.

# 1.2.6 - 2019-02-05

- Fix an issue with Angular/zone.js failing to patch our `MutationObserver` mock

# 1.2.5 - 2019-01-30

- Added JSDOM mocks for `CreateObjectUrl` and `MutationObserver`

- Added a parameter `{ chromatic: { disable: true } }` to skip a story in chromatic

- Added a parameter `{ chromatic: { noScroll: true } }` to avoid scrolling screenshots in (non-chrome) browsers.

# 1.2.3 - 2018-12-28

- Allow overwriting the polyfills we create in JSDOM mode. (This is a bugfix for some libraries that bundle their own polyfills).

# 1.2.2 - 2018-12-10

- Allow controlling package initialization timing via `import configure from 'storybook-chromatic/configure'; configure()`

- Add a flag `--ignore-last-build-on-branch=X` to not use the last build on a branch no matter what (which helps with rebasing, see: http://docs.chromaticqa.com/branching-and-baselines#rebasing).

# 1.2.1 - 2018-12-04

- Update logging dependency from `loggly` to `node-loggly-bulk` due to security vulnerabilities.
  NOTE: this package was only used by our CLI tool and so there is no need for concern, but this new version should avoid tripping security tools.

# 1.2.0 - 2018-10-29

- Pass `chromatic` parameters from Storybook@4, supporting:

  - Viewports: http://docs.chromaticqa.com/viewports
  - Delay: http://docs.chromaticqa.com/delay

- Better logging from the package to allow us to debug build problems.

- Fix regression for node v6

- Fix for supporting stories that use Canvas APIs in JSDOM

# 1.1.0 - 2018-10-15

- Fix to work on Windows CI

# 1.0.2 - 2018-08-23

- Fix a bug with Live View and Storybook@3.4

# 1.0.1 - 2018-07-26

- We now set the `CHROMATIC_APP_CODE` variable for you, with explicit instructions to remove it (and set via CI) in less secure applications.

- Some small bugfixes to support unusual usages.

# 1.0.0 - 2018-07-02

- Renamed the package from `react-chromatic` to `storybook-chromatic`, to indicate support for all view layers that Storybook supports!

- Tweaked to focus soley on Storybook -- simply `import 'storybook-chromatic';` (no `/storybook-addon` required). Run tests with `chromatic test --app-code` (no `--storybook-addon` required).

- Changed some URL parameters for the test command:

  - `--port` renamed `--storybook-port`
  - `--url` renamed `--storybook-url`
  - `--app-path` removed (it's always `/iframe.html`, as per Storybook).
  - `--exec` added to run arbitrary commands as an alternative to `--script-name`
  - `--no-interactive` added to disable interactive mode (and we do so automatically when on CI)

- We no longer require you to have npm installed if you are using yarn.

- Small bug fixes for missing git repositories, various failure modes.

- We now track your Storybook version and view layer so we know when to ship/change features.

# As `react-chromatic`

# 0.8.4 - 2018-06-07

- Fix an issue for stories that use `navigator.mimeTypes`

# 0.8.3 - 2018-04-26

- Fix a bug where sometimes the package did not detect the checked out branch.

# 0.8.2 - 2018-04-18

- Better support for rebasing branches - we now always treat the last build on this branch as a baseline, even if strictly it is not a git ancestor of the current commit. This helps deal with the situation where you rebase a branch off master, and still want to use the previously approved snapshots.

- Improved support for CI systems, especially _Netlify_ and _Travis PR builds_. Travis PR builds are a special case, read more about how to handle them in Chromatic here: https://www.chromatic.com/docs/ci#travis

# 0.8.1 - 2018-03-28

- Fix a small bug in the git algorithm for old Chromatic projects.

# 0.8.0 - 2018-03-28

- Reworked the git baseline detection algorithm to use a different technique that should be more reliable across many different modes of usage.

- Gather stories from Storybook 3.4 without requiring direct installation.

- Added `--auto-accept-changes` to avoid approvals on certain branches

- Added `--only` flag to run a single story

# 0.7.11 - 2018-03-15

- Handle the case where the last few Chromatic builds were run against commits which are no longer in the repository (due to rebasing or squashing). This could cause the tool to crash or fail to find a baseline for a build.

- Add a `--url` argument to allow running tests against arbitrary running apps.

# 0.7.10 - 2018-02-22

- Small API change for querying build change counts.

# 0.7.9 - 2018-01-23

- Our test script now warns you if your Storybook logs any errors. This can sometimes help reveal subtle problems that are caused by the script evaluating your Storybook in JSDOM. If you have legitimate things logged to `console.error` this may cause noise---you should probably get rid of them.

# 0.7.8 - 2018-01-18

- We no longer write your app code to your `package.json` by default; instead we prefer you pass it via the `CHROMATIC_APP_CODE` environment variable. (You can still optionally use `--app-code=xyz` if you are comfortable with the security of your `package.json`).

- We now show the final part of your Story's kind as the component name in the Chromatic UI. So "Webapp/UserList" will appear in Chromatic as "UserList".

# 0.7.7 - 2017-12-21

- This version sends us a little more information about the environment the package runs in -- is it CI? which package version?

# 0.7.6 - 2017-12-19

- Fix an issue where we did not pass the context to stories in the right format.

# 0.7.5 - 2017-12-19

- We detect a running process on your app's port and don't try and start the app if so. Pass `--do-not-start` if you've already started the app.

# 0.7.3 - 2017-12-09

- We now upload your application bundle to our tunnel server directly from the package.
  This means that on slower uplinks, we no need to set arbitrary timeouts in our server process; instead we simply will not start your Chromatic build until we've verified the bundle has uploaded successfully.
