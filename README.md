## Using a `next` version

From time to time we pre-publish a `next` version of the package to test new features. To use the
next branch you can either:

### Using `npx`

Change your script to use the `next` dist-tag:

```bash
npx chromatic@next --project-token ...
```

### Using a dependency in `package.json`

Update to the latest `next` version with:

```bash
yarn add --dev chromatic@next

# or
npm i --save-dev chromatic@next
```

### Using the github action

Use our `chromatic-next` action:

```yaml
- uses: chromaui/action-next@v1
```

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome! We're available to chat via the Intercom widget on the documentation site.

### Compatibility & versioning

Compatibility is guaranteed between this package and Chromatic like so:

- Production Chromatic ensures it‚Äôs compatible with what‚Äôs on npm
- What's on the main branch is equal to what's published on npm
- This package ensures it‚Äôs compatible with production Chromatic

To facilitate upgrading in the future, removing and adding features, this is the process:

- Any new features will have to be on Chromatic production before they could be used in this package
- We can add feature flags to be able to test new functionality
- Chromatic production can not remove any features this package depends on until after the usage has been removed from this package in addition to a grace period to allow users to upgrade

### Building and running locally

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed with `yarn install`
2. Build + watch the code locally: `yarn dev`
3. Run a build of all the CLI's stories against a Chromatic project: `yarn chromatic -t <token>`.

#### Running against staging

```bash
CHROMATIC_INDEX_URL=https://index.staging-chromatic.com yarn chromatic -t 253df72b53d2
```

#### Running against development

To test against a local development version of the Chromatic stack, use

```bash
CHROMATIC_INDEX_URL=https://index.dev-chromatic.com yarn chromatic -t <token>
```

To only test a small number of test stories as a smoke test, use:

```bash
SMOKE_TEST=1 CHROMATIC_INDEX_URL=https://index.dev-chromatic.com yarn chromatic -t <token>
```

### Publishing a new version to npm

Before publishing, make sure you've done the following:

- Updated CHANGELOG.md
- Committed and pushed everything (clean working directory)
- Decide on the proper semver bump (major/minor/patch)
- Decide on the proper tag (canary/next/latest)

We have three types of releases:

- `canary` releases are intended for testing purposes and should not be used in production, as they may only work against a staging or dev environment.
- `next` releases should be valid, working releases that can potentially be used by early adopters of new features, for example to handle a support request.
- `latest` releases are the general audience production releases, used by most people.

> For GitHub Actions, we publish `chromaui/action-canary` and `chromaui/action-next`, which contain the latest `canary` or `next` release, respectively. A `latest` release will also automatically update `chromaui/action-next` (besides `chromaui/action`), in order to keep users who happen to depend on `chromaui/action-next` up to date with the `latest` release.

A script is provided to create new releases:

```sh
yarn release <major|minor|patch> <canary|next|latest> [--dry-run]
```

This script ensures the version is bumped properly, the tag is set correctly and the corresponding GitHub Action is updated.

#### Examples:

```sh
yarn release patch canary
```

Releases e.g. `6.6.1-canary.0`.

```sh
yarn release major latest
```

Releases e.g. `7.0.0`.
