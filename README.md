### Compatibility & versioning

Compatibility is guaranteed between this package and Chromatic like so:

- Production Chromatic ensures it’s compatible with what’s on npm
- What's on the master branch is equal to what's published on npm
- This package ensures it’s compatible with production Chromatic

To facilitate upgrading in the future, removing and adding features, this is the process:

- Any new features will have to be on Chromatic production before they could be used in this package
- We can add feature flags to be able to test new functionality
- Chromatic production can not remove any features this package depends on until after the usage has been removed from this package in addition to a grace period to allow users to upgrade

### Publishing a new version to npm

```sh
npm version <major|minor|patch|prerelease> [--preid <tag>]
git push --follow-tags
npm publish [--tag <tag>]
```
